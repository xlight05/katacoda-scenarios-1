A basic Cellery installation (including Kubernetes runtime, Cellery Mesh runtime, and Cellery CLI) will start automatically and may take a few minutes to complete. This will set up an environment here in the cloud that you can try Cellery out with.

Once the installation is completed, run the following command to check that it is properly installed.  
`cellery version`{{execute}}

Great! You now have a running Cellery environment in the cloud. Letâ€™s proceed to the next steps to try out your first application on Cellery.
